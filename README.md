# ESG Case Converter

Vite + React + TypeScript.

This project uses TailwindCSS to match the Canvas/ESG look.
If Tailwind is missing, the UI will degrade (classes won't apply), which is why previous deployments looked different.

## Run
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Deploy to Vercel
Framework: Vite
Build: `npm run build`
Output: `dist`
